# NLP
The project was done for Metro College of Technolgy with following tasks:
•	Query data and preprocess unstructured text data (data cleansing, text tokenizing and lemmatizing) by Python 
•	Conduct data validation and feature engineering following requirements, perform A/B testing based on target class 
•	Perform EDA analysis to explore the fundamentals of the data and visualize results by Python (matplotlib, seaborn) 
•	Create and compare models using simple logistic, SVM, tree based and pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms
•	Prepare reports and presentation, provided data-driven recommendations [available](https://github.com/kshitijmamgain/NLP/blob/master/Kshitij_Mamgain_Python-Project%20-.pdf)

Working for Twitter Sentiment Analysis. Tried the following:
-  SVM with POS ~ 85% accuracy
-  LSTM ~ 84% accuracy
-  Pretrained Bert ~ 92% accuracy
-  NLP on PySpark achieved 85% accuracy
